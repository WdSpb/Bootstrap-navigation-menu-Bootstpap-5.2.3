The files presented in this repository are a fairly deep reworking of the Navigation component from Bootstrap 5 v5.2.3

To complete the implementation, you need to:
1. Create a `search.php` file to handle search queries
2. Implement the search logic and display the results on this page
3. Set up a redirect after a successful search

This is if you decide to develop your own application or SMS

If you are going to implement this solution in any of the existing CMS, the CMS will do it itself.

The redirect to search.php presented in the index.html file:

<form class="d-flex d-lg-none mt-3 mt-lg-0" method="POST" action="search.php" role="search">

100% suitable for CMS Wordpress.
