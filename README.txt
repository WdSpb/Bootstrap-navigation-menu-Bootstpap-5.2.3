The files provided in this repository are a fairly deep rework of the Navigation component from Bootstrap 5 v5.2.3

To complete the implementation, you need to:
1. Create a `search.php` file to handle search queries
2. Implement the search logic and output the results on this page
3. Set up a redirect after a successful search
